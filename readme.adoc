= jMolecules BOM

A simple BOM to ease the consumption of jMolecules JARs.

== Usage

[source, xml]
----
<dependencyManagement>
	<dependencies>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.jmolecules</groupId>
			<artifactId>jmolecules-bom</artifactId>
			<version>2021.1.0</version>
			<type>pom</type>
			<scope>import</scope>
		</dependency>
	</dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
----

NOTE: Unfortunately versions defined via a BOM are not considered when declaring Maven Plugin dependency versions.
I.e. if you e.g. use the ByteBuddy integration, you will still need to declare the version explicitly.

== Released versions

[options="header"]
|===
|BOM Version|jMolecules|jMolecules Integrations
|2021.2.1-SNAPSHOT|1.4.0|0.7.0-SNAPSHOT
|2021.2.0|1.4.0|0.6.0
|2021.1.0|1.3.0|0.5.0
|2021.0.2|1.2.0|0.4.0
|2021.0.1|1.2.0|0.3.0
|2021.0.0|1.2.0|0.2.0

== Version scheme

jMolecules BOM uses https://calver.org/[CalVer] with the following segment semantics:

* 202x -- the year of the release. Thus, will -- tautologically -- increase every year.
* minor digit -- a spec level. I.e. If the version of the jMolecules API JARs is increased in the release, we will bump that segment.
* bugfix digit -- the integrations level. Will be bumped if an integration release is included.
Will be reset for every release including a spec bump.

=== Example

* 2021.0.0 contained jMolecules 1.2 and jMolecules Integrations 0.2
* 2021.0.1 contained jMolecules 1.2 and jMolecules Integrations 0.3

A new release of the API JARs in 2021 will cause a BOM of 2021.1.0 to be released etc.
